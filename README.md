# Yahtzee
A final project made for BCIT Comp 1510. 

Play a simple game of Yahtzee in the terminal with two players. All rules adhere to Yahtzee's wikipage. 

Users take turn rolling die and keeping/removing die until their scoreboard is completely filled. Once both player scoresheets are filled out, the player with the most points wins.
